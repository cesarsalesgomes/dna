# DNA

Fullstack prototipe project in Typescript, with the objective of joining three well-regarded tools in the community (`back-end` **[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)** / **[Directus](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/introduction/)**, `front-end` **[Angular](https://angular.io/)**) in order to create an initial environment with the main necessary settings that a project commonly requires during its lifetime, so during its development try to focus as much as possible only on the code development required by the application.

<br />

## **Development** ‚ö°Ô∏è

### Local development environment:

1. Clone this repo with git.

2. Install back-end and front-end dependencies by running `npm install` within both directories (`nestjs` and `angular`).

3. Start the back-end development server with `docker-compose up` under the folder `dna`.

4. Start the front-end development server with `ng serve`.

5. Open development site by going to [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.
6. Open Directus configuration site by going to [`http://localhost:8055`](http://localhost:8055) in your browser.

<br />

## **GraphQL SDK** üöÄ

### Steps to generate the database models and operations in typescript for equalized use on back-end between NestJS & Directus:

1. Generate admin access token using Directus authentication login: <br />

   > **[[Directus] Authentication reference](https://docs.directus.io/reference/api/system/authentication/)**

2. Store access token in the DOCKER_DNA_DIRECTUS_ACCESS_TOKEN enviroment variable.

3. With development docker environment running, run `npm run generate`.

4. The sdk will be available in the **`nestjs/graphql`**
   folder, under the **`sdk`** file.

<br />

## **Response format** üëã

The response pattern followed the Directus return response. Thus, it was necessary to adjust the NestJS return pattern to fit and return in the same format.

For this, it was used the interface already provided by the [graphql-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) library already installed and used in the GraphQL SDK, which returns the responses in the same standard as Directus.

<br />

```typescript
interface GraphQLResponse<T = any> {
  data?: T;
  errors?: GraphQLError[];
  extensions?: any;
  status: number;
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

<br />

## **Migration** üöö

`Directus` added a **[PR](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/7939)**, thus being possible to easily generate and save snapshots of the development enviroment and export/import the data model from/to various Directus instances.

Below are the steps to export the schema generated by your docker directus instance to your cloud directus instance:

1. Start the development enviroment.

2. Go to the folder `dna-migration` and run **npm start** (It will generate the schema inside the docker instance, and move the generated schema to the current migration directory).

3. Copy the schema generated to your cloud enviroment.

4. Run **npx directus schema apply /path/to/schema.yaml**.

<br />

## **Tests** ‚úÖ

For the testing stage, all the well-known and recommended structure of the **[NestJS Testing Module](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing)** was used, leaving it responsible for `UNIT TESTING` and `INTEGRATED TESTING`, applying them according to what the system needs during its development.

For the `END-TO-END`, **[Cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)** will be used, a framework already well recognized and recommended by the community, due to its ease and great integration with Angular.

### Examples:

> **[UNIT TESTING](https://github.com/cesarsalesgomes/dna/blob/main/nestjs/src/system/system.spec.ts)**

_Test example in which were concerned with covering a portion of the business layer of the system module, without integration with other layers, such as the data layer._

> **[INTEGRATION TESTING](https://github.com/cesarsalesgomes/dna/blob/main/nestjs/src/cat/cat.spec.ts)**

_Example of test in call of a system route, in which the call to the data layer was abstracted, trying to cover as much as possible the Directus service._

_The automatic generation of false data, generated from the **[graphql-codegen-typescript-mock-data plugin](https://github.com/ardeois/graphql-codegen-typescript-mock-data#readme)**, was also provided in the `generate` script, so as to take advantage of `GraphQL` and thus obtain agility in the development of the tests._

> **[E2E TEST]()**

_Will be documented when starting Angular development ..._

<br />

## **Authentication** üîí

### To obtain an authentication token and gain access to the routes developed in the application, perform the steps below:

1. Generate access token using Directus authentication login: <br />

   > **[[Directus] Authentication reference](https://docs.directus.io/reference/api/system/authentication/)**

2. Pass the token in the Authorization header (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`):

   > **`Authorization: Bearer eyJh...KmUk`**

<br />

## **Deployment** ‚òÅÔ∏è

After research and attempts to deploy the application via docker compose in the `Azure` environment, it was noticed that the ease of execution and configuration of the development environment is not the same in cloud environments with docker.

In this way, it was decided to deploy each system layer in parts, researching the environment where its configuration was simpler and more intuitive, less costly and with better support.

<br />

> **Directus / Database**

_It was chosen to deploy the `Directus` on the **[AWS](https://aws.com)** enviroment. It has a basic unpaid plan of 1 year to its EC2 basic instance (Thus being more attractive to customers and creation of POC's) and greater freedom for machine configuration._

_Even having more steps of installation and manual configuration, the environment was chosen due to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintegrating it with **[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)**, thus obtaining only one IP in production (with reverse proxy), and to take advantage of the good and free server monitoring tool **[Amplify](https://amplify.nginx.com)**, explained in the next topic._

_**IMPORTANT**: The idea behind the configuration of the reverse proxy, is to redirect all calls that contain `nestjs` in their route for the NestJS server configured in the Heroku environment created in the next section; and redirect all other calls to the Directus enviroment, thus obtaining the environment configuration with only one ip. For that, then, **ALL** controllers created in the NestJS environment will need to have `nestjs` in their configuration (Ex: /nestjs/cats)._

_Also remembering that continuous integration with Git will not be necessary, as there will be no code development in this environment, being only necessary to update the environment when necessary through the steps in **[Directus update guide](https://docs.directus.io/configuration/upgrades-migrations/)**._

_Below are the steps to create the environment:_

1. Have in hand the credentials of the chosen cloud database (Recommended: `AWS RDS Mysql Database`, due to gratuity).

2. Follow the steps of the **[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adQDNRZ59r0)** to install Nginx, SSL and NodeJS on an AWS EC2 FreeTier instance.

3. Create the project following the steps on **[Directus Quickstart Guide](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/quickstart/)** using the database production credentials. The recommend directory is `/home/ec2-user` (The command `sudo su` will be necessary).

4. Start the project using the **[Directus Linux tutorial](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/installation/ubuntu/)** with `pm2`, to keep the application alive.

5. Copy the file `dna.conf` on the nginx folder, to the directory `etc/nginx/conf.d` on the EC2 instance folder.

6. Replace the three variables **{{HEROKU_NESTJS_API_URL}}** on the `dna.conf` file with the Heroku app Public IP created in the next section.

7. Replace the variable **{{NESTJS_PUBLIC_DNS}}** with the DNS acquired necessary in the step 2.

8. Restart the Nginx server with the command `systemctl restart nginx`.

**Issues:**

1. **[Configuration to connect to AWS RDS MySql Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng_zi11N4_c&t=445s)**

<br />

> **NestJS**

_The `NestJS` layer was configured on the Heroku enviroment. Due to being the business layer, and needing more code deployment, Heroku was chosen due to the simplicity of connecting to Github and performing continuous integration, still being free. To deploy it, it is necessary to:_

1. Init a git repository on the **nestjs** folder (**Note:** As it is not recommended to create nested git projects, copy and paste the `nestjs` folder outside of the dna environment, and start a git repository alone).

2. Connect it to a Heroku application.

3. Set the enviroment variable **DIRECTUS_IP** to the Directus domain previously created on Aws (Ex: https://www.dna-directus.com)

<br />

## **Monitoring** üõ°Ô∏è

Monitoring a Node application is a very important step in the system, so that it is possible to monitor the performance of the system in a fast, simple, efficient and intuitive way.

As the idea of the environment is to look for tools with the highest cost-benefit, and motivated by the 4 question on the Rocketseat **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrkECIzaQvE)** recommendation on which tools to use for monitoring NodeJS applications, **[Nginx Amplify](https://amplify.nginx.com)** monitoring Linux was chosen.

Much because it was developed by the `Nginx` developers themselves, because of the excellent documentation, easy instalation, free plan for knowledge of the tool, and many other motivations.

To install the tool on an AWS EC2 instance (Amazon Linux), use the steps below:

1. After installing Nginx in the previous section on an AWS EC2 instance, follow the steps in this **[link](https://amplify.nginx.com/docs/guide-installing-and-managing-nginx-amplify-agent.html#installing-on-centos-red-hat-linux-or-amazon-linux)** to install Amplify on Amazon Linux

**Issues:**

1. Many dependency errors with `Python` occurred while trying to install Amplify. To fix the dependencies, use the **[Python dependency errors link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8087184/installing-python-3-on-rhel)**, to install the necessary versions informed in the attempts to install the package `nginx-amplify-agent package`.
